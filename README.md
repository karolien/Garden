<h1>Garden</h1>

Not really sure where I'm going to go with this program yet. Initial idea is to have a 'garden' with different plants that you need to keep alive by constantly watering them; and if you neglect to water them, or you water them too much, they die.

Going to start with a very simple implementation and expand on it as new ideas come to mind :)
